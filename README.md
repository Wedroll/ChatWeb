# ChatWeb

The project is dedicated to a simple implementation of a web chat application using Java, with the Spring framework and libraries such as Vaadin, Maven, and Lombok. The chat is launched on localhost:8080 and operates through WebSocket. Users have a simplified registration process, which only requires a login. After registration, a room is created with another registered user. Instead of using a database, the project utilizes a Queue data structure, which serves as storage for user logins and messages, allowing further interaction with this data.
